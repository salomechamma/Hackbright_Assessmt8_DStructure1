Runtime

    When calculating the Big O notation for a particular algorithm, it’s necessary to consider the length of time it takes for the algorithm to run as the algorithm’s workload approaches infinity. You can think of the workload as the number of tasks required to complete a job. What determines the workload of figuring out whether your box of animal crackers contains an elephant?
    ==> The number crackers in the box
    Order the following runtimes in descending order of efficiency (that is, fastest runtimes first, slowest last) as n approaches infinity:
        O(log n)
        O(n2)
        O(n log n)
        O(n)
        O(2n) (i.e. 2 to the n-th power)
        O(1)

 ==> O(1) < O(log n) <  O(n) < O(2n) < O(n log n) < O(n2)
